title: About The Open World Forum

## A Unique Event

The Open World Forum is the first European summit to gather political representatives, decision-makers and experts, in one place, in order to debate the technological, economic and social impacts that the Free and Open-Source technologies bring to market. The forum was first held in 2008, and is now organized annually in Paris, France, with more than 200 speakers coming from 40 countries, and a global audience that was 2100-people strong in 2012.

## Organization and Governance

The Open World Forum is held in partnership with all the major international communities ([Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/), [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/), and the main French Open Software agencies ([Adullact](http://www.adullact.org/), [AFUL](http://www.aful.org/), [CNLL](http://www.cnll.fr/), [PLOSS](http://www.ploss.fr/), [Silicon Sentier](http://siliconsentier.org/)), with the support of the European (European Commission) and French (Paris City Hall, the Ile-de-France Region and the Regional Development Agency) organisations. The Open World Forum is partnered with 70% of the major IT companies in the world.
