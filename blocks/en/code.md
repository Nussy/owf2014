"CODE" will help you better understand and leverage your own projects by exposing  the key subjects that are transforming the open source ecosystem: Web, mobile phones and tablets, Big Data, cloud infrastructure, software quality, emerging languages and platforms... CODE will also be your opportunity to meet key specialists in these fields. During two days (Friday and Saturday) CODE is there to bring back an engineering and technical excellence after years of sales and marketing domination.
